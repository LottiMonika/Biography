# Biography

With a strong foundation in data analytics, workforce planning, and customer service excellence, I have consistently demonstrated a passion for process optimization and cross-functional collaboration throughout my career. I am currently expanding my expertise at the London School of Economics & Political Science (LSE), where I am gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets and developing advanced skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and business intelligence. My studies focus on using tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Tableau to drive data-driven decision-making, equipping me with the knowledge to solve complex business challenges.

At Catawiki B.V. in the Netherlands, I recently served as a Workforce Planner & Analyst, playing a pivotal role in creating stability and enhancing response times for a team of approximately 200 customer service employees across eight language teams. I designed and implemented efficient scheduling processes in a multi-skill environment, trained schedulers, and developed both short- and long-term forecasts for various customer service channels. Additionally, I created automated dashboards to monitor performance at the individual, team, and departmental levels, and led the rollout of Verint WFO and JIRA project management systems, overseeing implementation, process development, and training initiatives.

Prior to this, as a Commercial Operations Process Coordinator at Catawiki, I led successful rollouts of new features for a large group of experts and optimized sales tools. I designed and trained teams on processes related to the Kustomer ticketing system and published critical resources, such as the Seller Submission Guidelines, through extensive collaboration across teams. I also introduced JIRA to streamline project tracking and promoted cross-team collaboration with innovative shadowing sessions.

Combining my practical experience in workforce planning with my academic focus on data analytics, I am driven to continue developing data-driven solutions that optimize business operations and improve organizational outcomes.
