# Biography

I am a detail-oriented Data Analyst with a strong foundation in workforce planning, process improvement, and data visualization. With over 7 years of experience across diverse roles in analytics, customer service, and operational planning, I specialize in turning complex datasets into actionable insights that drive business efficiency and growth.

In my current role as a Workforce Planner & Analyst, I manage scheduling, forecasting, and performance dashboards for a workforce of over 200 employees across multiple languages and channels. My expertise spans tools like Tableau, Google Data Studio, PostgreSQL, Python, and R, enabling me to create automated solutions that improve efficiency and provide real-time insights for stakeholders.

My previous roles as a Process Coordinator and Customer Service Excellence Specialist have honed my ability to identify pain points, design streamlined workflows, and implement software solutions like JIRA and Verint WFO. These experiences have cultivated my skills in stakeholder management, process optimization, and cross-functional collaboration.

I am currently advancing my knowledge with a Data Analytics program at the London School of Economics, where I am further developing my statistical modeling and machine learning skills. I am passionate about leveraging data to solve complex problems, create scalable processes, and deliver measurable business impact.
